# Core Neuroscience: Understanding Your Brain's Operating System

Welcome to the foundation of the ADHD Mastery Path. Here, we dive into the hardcore neuroscience that explains the unique strengths and challenges of the ADHD brain.

## The Goal

To move from feeling at the mercy of your brain to understanding and commanding it. Knowledge is power, and here we lay the groundwork for all the practical strategies to come.
