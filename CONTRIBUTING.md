# How to Contribute to the Collective Brain

Your unique, non-standard thinking is your contribution. No pull request is too small.

## Ways to Contribute:

1.  **Share a Tactic:** Found a weird trick that works? Add it to the relevant `.md` file via a Pull Request.
2.  **Challenge a Claim:** Read something that doesn't match your experience or the latest science? **This is vital.** Open an Issue and let's debate it. We seek truth, not dogma.
3.  **Share a Resource:** Found a great paper, video, or tool? Add it to `05-The-Collective-Brain/contributed-resources/`.
4.  **Tell Your Story:** How did you "hijack your environment"? Share your success story.
5.  **Just Discuss:** Jump into GitHub Discussions. Ask questions, provide support, brainstorm.

## Contribution Rules:

*   **Be Scientific:** Where possible, link to or reference neuroscience.
*   **Be Respectful:** We are all experts on our own experience.
*   **Be Action-Oriented:** Frame advice as "This worked for me because..." not "You should..."

**You are not broken. You are a pioneer. Let's build this path together.**
