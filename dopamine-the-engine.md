# Dopamine: The Fuel, The Compass, The Quest

**Myth:** "ADHD is a dopamine *deficit*."
**Truth:** "ADHD is a dopamine **management** issue."

Your brain runs on a dopamine-based motivation system. For the neurotypical brain, it's a reliable sedan. For the ADHD brain, it's a Formula 1 car with a tiny fuel tank and a finicky GPS.

## What's Actually Happening?

*   **Tonic vs. Phasic Release:** You have lower *baseline* (tonic) dopamine, which leads to boredom and under-stimulation. But you have explosive, powerful *phasic* releases for novel, interesting, or urgent tasks. This is why boring tasks feel physically painful and hyperfocus is so intense.
*   **The Dopamine Gradient:** Your brain struggles to use the *anticipation* of a reward to fuel effort. The reward must be **now**, **novel**, or **personally meaningful**.
*   **Receptor Density & Clearance:** You may have different dopamine receptor distributions and faster dopamine clearance in key brain regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex. This means dopamine doesn't "stick around" long enough to maintain focus on non-stimulating tasks.
